Golang Machine Learning is a library aimed at providing ML functionality and capability to Go. Several packages provide usage with neural networks, clustering algorithms, and reinforcement learning.

## Installation
The library currently contains only pure Go. Installation can be done using `go get`.
```
go get -u github.com/thadUra/Golang-Machine-Learning
```
