# Golang Machine Learning with Custom Soccer Environment

### Description (WIP)

OLD:
This project aims to experiment with Reinforced Deep Q-Learning algorithms and techniques in combination with multithreading to see if it is feasible, efficient, and effective. Model building is computationally extensive and time consuming. Thus, multithreading possibly introduces a means to improve the field. 

To build the game environment and neural network, I decided to use Golang. Python, being the most popular, is not the fastest. C/C++ is fast, but not memory safe. To implement multithreading in a productive, fast, and memory safe way made Golang optimal.

NEW:
TBD
